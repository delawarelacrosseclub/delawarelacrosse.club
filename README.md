## About Us

We generally keep a roster of about 40 players. Every season starts with the goal of winning the National Championship. We compete within Division 1 of the NCLL.

##### Tryouts

Tryouts occur at the beginning of each semester. We expect to take 12-15 players each Fall and about 5 players each Spring. Tryout dates will be posted prior to the start of each semester.
