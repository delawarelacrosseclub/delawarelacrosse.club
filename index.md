								<span class="image main"><img src="images/UD_Background.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Delaware Lacrosse Club is the University of Delaware's club level men's lacrosse team. We are an entirely student-run club which competes in the first division of the <a href="https://ncllax.com/">NCLL</a>. This means that we play against programs at other mid-atlantic area colleges.</p>
								<p>Our club places a focus on athletic, social, and philanthropic efforts. As a team, our mission is to win games and uphold principles of good sportsmanship and as a club, our aim is create a co-curricular environment which provides a memorable and meaningful college experience.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Try Out</h2>
								
								<p>Tryouts will occur at the beginning of each semester. Tryouts take place over the course of three days, during which time the number of potential new members is whittled down to the players who can demonstrate the best lacrosse skill. Tryouts will be full gear and full speed and will likely and consist of a variety of drills, with a full field scrimmage concluding each day. </p>
								<p>For information about specific tryout dates, keep checking this page. New players interested in trying out are encouraged to come to talk to the team at Club Sports Night, which is held at the beginning of each semester in the Carpenter Sports Building. For any questions, new players should see the contact section of this website to get in touch with the president of the team. Any new players who are unable to tryout, or who arenâ€™t available for any of the tryout dates should also get into contact with us as soon as possible. We typically add about ten players to our roster in the Fall and about five in the Spring.</p>
								<h2 class="major">Cost</h2>
								<p>Because Delaware Lacrosse Club is student-run, we are also self funded. We endeavor to keep dues for players as low as possible to make the team accesible to as many people as we can. First year players can expect to pay about $400, while returning players will pay about $300 per semester. This money is used to pay the cost of uniforms, referees, and fields for our games. For specific information about the cost of dues, contact us.</p>
								<h2 class="major">Playing for DLC</h2>
								<p>Delaware Lacrosse Club competes in the National College Lacrosse League, which means we play clubs from other Universities in the mid-Atlantic area, just like an NCAA lacrosse team. Our team provides a real college lacrosse experience while allowing students to balance other aspects of their college life that would be nearly impossible on an NCAA team.</p>
								<p>Players should expect to play two tournaments during the fall semester and about ten games in the spring. The NCLL also hosts a playoff tournament at the conclusion of the spring season. Our goal as a team each year is to win the national championship.</p>
